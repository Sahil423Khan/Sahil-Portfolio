              Hi Myself Sahil Khan ,I am a frontend developer I am new in this
              field I am learning new skills day by day so I can be a good or
              better developer by the time ,So I am learning some programing
              languages and frameworks to become a Full Stack Web Devloper
              ,before coming in this field I was learning the basics in
              programming such as c,c++ and java(basics and intermediate). Now
              my primary focus is on Web Development and Mobile application
              development. My skillset is in HTML CSS and Java Script as now and
              it will be updating every month ,new programing languages and
              frameworks will be added by the time. As I am new in this field
              till now I had not worked in any projects so idont have enough
              experience or no experience but you can have a idea by seeing this
              portfolio because i had built it on my own ,by taking inspiration
              by some developers videos on portfolio amd adding some more
              things(ideas) to it by myself.
